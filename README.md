# ü™® Storymodelers' Rosetta Stone

**An AI-Enabled Device for Capturing, Analyzing, and Modeling Human Team Dynamics**

---

## üìñ Overview

The Storymodelers' Rosetta Stone is a portable, sensor-integrated AI system designed to capture multimodal data during real-world team interactions. By combining speech, environmental, and physiological signals, the device enables advanced analysis of group dynamics, emotional arousal, and communication patterns in collaborative environments.

Originally developed for research into AI-human teaming, participatory research, and interdisciplinary collaboration, the Rosetta Stone provides an open foundation for studying human interaction in meetings, workshops, clinical settings, or field studies.
